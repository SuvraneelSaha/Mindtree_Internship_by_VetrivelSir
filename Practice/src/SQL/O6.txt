USING MULTIPLE TABLES

in order to describe a table
we use
either desc or describe command
ex - desc people ;
or describe people;

Q : select rows where people work in delish
and jucies

ans - select * from people
      where team ='Delish' or team = 'Jucies';

if there are 5 -7 values in case of team
then writting or is not applicable

this is where we use IN CLAUSE

ex - select * from people
     where team in ('Delish','Jucies');
as it is text values everything needs to be in ''
single quotation marks


IN CLAUSE - command - in (parameters or conditions)
