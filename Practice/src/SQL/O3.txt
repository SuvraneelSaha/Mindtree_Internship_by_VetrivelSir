Where Clause

in case of mysql
date format is YY MM DD

select * from sales
where amount > 10000 and SaleDate >='2022-01-01';
// select all the rows whose amount > 10000 and the date is greater than
2022- 01-01

select SaleDate , Amount from sales
where amount > 10000 and year(SaleDate) = 2022
order by amount desc;
// selects the rows with columns saledate and amount
and the rows will be accoring to the amount in descending order

// Q: lets find out the sales where the number of boxes is between 0 to 50
select * from sales
where boxes > 0 and boxes <=50;
// will show all the rows with all the boxes but only the rows
with the boxes > 0 and boxes <= 50 will be shown

Alternative Method to the same above query
select * from sales
where boxes between 0 and 50 ;

here by using the between keyword
we need to know that the 0 is also inclusive
