HOW TO IMPOSE ANY CONDITION USING SELECT STATMENT and Where

select * from sales
where Amount > 10000;
// selects all the rows which has amount greater than 10000

where is just like if (in java)

select * from sales
where Amount > 10000
order by amount desc;
// shows rows with column amount having value more than 10000


// amount in descending order
// otherwise in default case ascending order


select * from sales
where GeoID='g1'
order by PID , Amount desc;
// selects all the rows whose GeoId is g1
and it orders it by Pid and Amount Descending

// and where clause is (if statement in Java)
// order by is like sorting
