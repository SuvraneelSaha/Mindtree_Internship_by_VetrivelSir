        while loop - entry controlled loop
        do while - Exit controlled loop

        in case of do while loop
        there will be at least 1 output or execution


        ex case -
        when there is an atm
        and in case of money withdrawal or atm functions

        if we use do while then it will be a problem
        cause there would be no check

        if pin == correct pin
        then only opening
        otherwise if we use do while then it will be a problem


        if the while condition satisfied then
        it will work

        if the condition is not satisfied then it will wont work
