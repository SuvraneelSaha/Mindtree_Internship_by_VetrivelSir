what is a database ?
it is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed
in order to manage databases we use dbms

we connect to dbms for quering or modifying our data

these are of two categories
 relational and non relational

 rel dbms - sql language
 rdbms - mysql , sql server and oracle

so we use sql to work with rdbms like mysql
